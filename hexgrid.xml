    <SYNOPSIS>
       Create a regular hexagonal grid and apply to input image
    </SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
        <PARA>
        hexgrid creates a uniform grid of hexagonal shaped regions.
        Hexagons are highest order polygon which can be used to 
        uniformly tile a plane; thus they are are the closest approximation
        to a circular grid.
        All hexagons have the same size and orientation.  Users can
        specify a center location which centers one of the hexagons;
        the rest of the field then is shifted to accommodate this 
        constraint.
        </PARA>

        <PARA>
        The output from hexgrid is a map file, where the pixel values
        indicate to which group each pixel belongs.
        If a binimg is supplied, hexgrid will apply the 
        grouping to the infile and the result saved in the binimg file.

          <DESC>
            <PARA>
    This example creates an output map file, hex.map, the same size and 
    dimensions as the input file, img.fits.  Each hexagon 
    will have a side length=10 pixels (in image or logical pixel).
    Note: due to quantization, the side length may vary +/-1.
            </PARA>
           <PARA>
    If the input image contains any pixel values that have a value of NaN,
    or are outside the image's data subspace, then those pixels will
    be left ungrouped (map values equal to zero).           
           </PARA>
            <PARA>
     The output image contains integer values, where pixels with the same
     value belong to the same hexagon.  Note that the pixel values
     do not always start at one (1), nor are they guaranteed to be
     consecutive.  A pixel value equal to zero (0) means that the
     pixel is ungrouped.

        Same as the previous example; however, a reference location
        has been specified.  The reference location is specified
        in logical (image) coordinates.  When these parameters are
        set, the tool will adjust the starting location of the
        hexagonal grid such that the reference position is
        in the center of a hexagon.

            <PARA>
        Same as first example, except with the binimg parameter
        specified, the script will apply the grouping scheme
        in the hex.map output file to the img.fits infile, and
        output the binned image, hex.img.

              The pixel values indicate which pixels are grouped
              together by the algorithm.  A pixel value of 0 are pixels
              which are ungrouped (ie outside the image subspace).

                the tool has lower limit of 3 image pixels; smaller
                than that and the hexagons become squares.
